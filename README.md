# Useful Stats

## 📖 **About**

This repository was initiated by [SST](https://github.com/sarahsmithtripp) to share easy-to-use resources for the application of various statistical analysis methods and techniques.  We have included resources that provide a good introduction to data analysis, covering key concepts, examples of how to interpret results and code to implement various approaches. However, if a more in-depth understanding is required, we recommend that you consult a traditional statistics textbook. 

We organize this repository by datatype and assumption not met, that migh guide which approach is most addequate to use. All the resources include code written in `R`.<br>.
